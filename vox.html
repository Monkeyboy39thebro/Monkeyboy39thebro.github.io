	<h3>Baby V.O.X.'s Debut Song - To Men (Democracy)</h3>


	<h4>This is Baby VOX's debut song called To Men. The lyrics are confusing with each verse and chorus having a different scenario but all relating to one thing which is men cheating and society changing them while all they want to love someone</h4>

	<h4>This song was only promoted for about a month before being changed due to censorship in Korea. Due to them being the first Modern Girl Group and their concept being on talking about heavy topics and speaking their minds, hence VOX's abreviation being Voice Of Xpression. The song was deemed as being to controversial by koreans and it wasnt long before the group had to change songs.</h4>

	<h4>Even in a interview with the group in 2025, two of the members who have been in the group during this time were somewhat confused on the lyrics as each part had different scenarios but they all led to one thing in common. The narration was done by the leader, HyeonJeong who still rememebers it and jokes around with how deep she made her voice and how even with being in the group for that short but being planned to be in it for years, she still enjoyed her time.</h4>

	<h4>The song was later changed to another called "Haircut" and it talks about how cutting your hair makes you change and forget about the past even when they loved their style but was ruined by their partner. This song had almost 4 different choreography and was learned in such a short amount of time with barely any breaks, which led to member Cha Yumi having a leg injury and still performing with it. Once she had it checked she was told on needing rest and when her family found out, they told her to come back home as she was Korean-American and moved back. Years later in a interview, she spoke about the situation and how she regretted her choice in leaving the group but was stil happy in how the group paved a way for many other girl groups.</h4>


	<h3>Artist Description</h3>

	<h3>Lineup 1</h3>
	
	<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">

	</div>
	

	<p class= "bordered-text"; style="font-size: 17px;">When they debuted, the members were Kim EZ (18), Cha Yumi (20), Jung HyeonJeon (20), Jung Shiwoon (21) and Lee Heejin (17). </p>

	<p style="font-size: 17px;">This group made the first album and had a rebellious concept using concepts like the bad side of breakups and how single mothers may feel. But during the middle of promotions, Yumi left due to a leg injury and with the company not allowing her to rest, she chose to leave. To replace her for the end of promotions they added 16 year old Kan Miyoun to continue. By the end of the 1st album promotions, Both HyeonJeon and Shiwwon left for different careers and also the company thinking the age gap between members were too high.</p>

  	<img src="bby2.jpg"  style="width:700px;" style="height:800px;" />

	</div>

	<p>For the second album they added two new members, Shim Eunjin (17) and Lee Gai (20) alongside Kan Miyoun for the group to continue. The concept changed to a band style but was quickly erased and changed to the popularised innocent crush concept. During promotions, fans were confused over member Lee Gai looking odly older for her age. This then went on to calling her Auntie and even making fun of her errors when performing.</p>

	<h3>Incident</h3>

  	<img src="gai.png"  style="width:700px;" style="height:800px;" />

	</div>

	<p>During a interview with a soccer player, a fan hated the interaction and instead went on a deepdive to find ou that she was actually a decade older. This then went on to fans wanting her out of the group even when the company wanted her as a veteran and help the rest knowing her age to then changing their story and leaving Gai on her own to then leave the group by the end of the album. </p>

	<h3>Final Lineup</h3>

	<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;border-radius: 60px;">

  	<img src="bby3.jpg"  style="width:700px;" style="height:800px;" />

	</div>

	<p> After the incident, the company recruited 15 year old, Yoon Eunhye who ironically was half of Gai's true age. But they kept with the lineup till the end but changed their concept back to what they were known for. Although there continuation led to many controversies in career they went on to be a successful group that broke barriers being the first korean girl group to make it to different part of Asia and even be popular in China and be the second girl group to to perform in North Korea while going a bit against the dress code without knowing. But sadly they ended in 2004 due to a lawsuit with Tupac's mother because of copyright of a recording while trying to make it to the U.S. market and later to 2006 the group left slowly before disbanding.</p>

	<h3>Lyrics Translation</h3>

	<p>There's a waiting that cracks little by little
in front of a separation that can't be denied</p>


<p>Think it wasn't meant to be</p>
<p>Forget it Does love feed you?</p>
<p>No, that can't be It'll come back</p>
<p>He said you loved me</p>

<p>Every time words of comfort rushed in
Those words I cried out inside
I'll forget them now</p>

<p>The wind is a disease, it can only be cured by death
I loved you without knowing it,
you one and only flirt, it had to be me
I will forget, I will erase everything from my memories<p>


<p>I met you by chance, another woman
I passed by without a second thought and laughed it off
Please break up, thank you
Yo'story Ma'story Now it's all history to me</p>

<p>Mom, please leave me alone
I'm not your doll </p>
<p>I want to dream freely like a little bird
flying in the sky</p>



<p>(Congratulations) You said you have a man</p>

<p>(It's a secret!) I'll be taken away by Minju </p>

<p>(Democracy!) , please succeed</p>
<p>(I'll keep that in mind) It 's for you, Minju Be careful</p>


<p>Don't compare me I'm just me </p>

<p>No matter what anyone says I'll go my own way</p>


<p>Mom and Dad loved
each other and wanted to get married</p>

<p>But I love secrets
Mom On the contrary, he's my secret</p>


<p>(You said) democracy failed you

<p>(It's all my fault) I couldn't keep him 

<p>	(I'm shocked) We're not even friends </p>
<p>(We're enemies) Don't curse The one who was taken away is an idiot, idiot</p>


<p>I live because you watch over me</p>

<p>I'll throw away all my hatred towards the world</p>


<p>I'm telling all the men in the world
Those who make women cry
Will be abandoned by a women.
They say thatwhen a woman harbors resentment,
frost falls even in May and June
That wasn't a legend</p>


<p>Deceived, deceived, deceived I was deceived
My heart is pounding My heart, twice again No,</p>

<p>I was fooled, fooled, fooled, I was fooled
, my heart is pounding, twice again No,</p>


<p>I want to live on my own
Now that I'm an adult,</p>

<p>I've opened my eyes to love
and found out that there's another world</p>

<P>Stop drinking, I 'm really getting drunk I wo
n't come back It's all over Leave
<P>me alone I'll cry for today and forget
<P>Democracy, that unsolvable homework

<P>I want to protect with my life</P>
<P>Everything becomes beautiful when I love you</P>

<P>Protect my love (Yes),</P>
<P>Don't let it be taken away (No),</P>
<P>now the tears (Stop),</P>
<P>Stop</P>
