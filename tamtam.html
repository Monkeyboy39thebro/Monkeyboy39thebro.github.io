	<h3>Context</h3>

	<p>TamTam is a Kpop Duo group that debuted in 1991 with members Lee Jisoo and Kang Hyunji, two people who were known in Korea at that time because of their girl group prior, Saetorae who are known as the pioneers to do a dance concept as a trio with their name meaning Three Peers because of them all being 19 and with their real names, Lee Hee Jung (Lee Jisoo) and Woo Yunah (Kang Hyunji).</p>

	<p>Saetorae was known as more of a innocent girl crush concept with their 1st album having a pop lighthearted feel and their 2nd album having a more direct sound for them in a dance feel with a sound of rock and what was known at the start of the 90's in Korea. They sadly disbanded due to many reasons, from one of the members immigrating to the U.S., their company going into bankruptcy and having Anti-fans who supposedly vandalized their van one time because of the group collaborating with a boy group that debuted a year prior who had the same concept and performed a wedding concept once.</p>

	<p>With all that Saetorae disbanded around early 1990 and not long after, Hee Jung and Yunah were picked up by singer Kim Chang Nam, who was also in a group and was now starting his own company. With him, they still kept their dance concept but instead of doing innocent love songs with a light-color palette, they focused on a mature concept with dark colored concepts, with mentions of ugly side of breakups and change to adulthood.</p>

	<p>Their Lead Single, "You should've told me", talked about how their partner was not being honest to them and calling them a fool for not telling them everything. <strong>The song</strong> I am showing is their follow up song translated as "Im so stupid", talks about the process of a breakup and trying to change their apperance but feeling outcasted from society, not knowing how to deal with a breakup and being able to not act like a fool in front of others as they deal with it. Their is 2 known performances of them doing this song, with both members showing emotion and having a fun time performing as the song is groovy even if the lyrics are much sadder.</p>

	<h4>Translated Lyrics</h4>

	<p> *This time when someone left my side and my heart is depressed</p>
	<p>I cant go outside and start to show it</p>
	<p>Im so stupid</p>

	<br>

	<p>**I put on heavy makeup and even cut my hair but I looked so weird</p>
	<p>So I just look down while walking on the street</p>
	<p>Im so stupid</p>

	<br>

	<p># It feels like every passerby is only looking at me.</p>
	<p>It just feels like I had made, commited some kind of crime</p>
	<p>What should I do now?</p>
	<p>Is this how every breakup is like?</p>

	<br>

	<p>## Once I got home, my mom asked me "What happened to you</p>
	<p>I didnt even answer as I locked myself in my room</p>
	<p>Im so Stupid</p>

	<br>
	<br>

	<p>* Repeat</p>
	<p>** Repeat</p>
	<p># Repeat</p>
	<p>## Repeat</p>
	<p>Im so Stupid</p>
	<p>Im so Stupid</p>
	<p>Im so Stupid</p>
