	<h3>S#arp's 2nd Album, 7th Track - Shall We Go?</h3>

	<h3>Context</h3>

	<p>This song is S#arp's 7th track from their 2nd album translated as Shall we go?. The song is really sweet and innocent talking about a sweet love and how they shouldnt be scared about anything that happens because their love will always be eternal. The narration is by member's Seokhyun and Sori who ironically even gained media attention at that time during promotions for being rumored to have dated but was then denied during that time. Member Chris, did not have any lines in this song being the only track in this album where he did not participate. </p>

	<p>I love this song as Sori's voice being gentle and innocent really displayed in this song and its really bittersweet as it shows that neither partner should have doubts or be scared to show their love towards each other.</p>

	<p>S#ARP is a kpop Co-ed group that had three different lineups. In their debut in 1998, it consisted of John Kim, Seo Ji Young, Oh Hee Jung, Lee Ji Hye, and Jang Seok hyun and they debuted with a Hip Hop, Rap conept with a mix of pop and funk. During Promotions, their company added Christopher Kim, a rapper who used to be in a duo in early 98', who is known as a guest with the group. Also during promotions, HeeJung left due to health complications and family conflicts as she was in the group. By the end, John Kim left the group due to differences for the plans in the next album and also due to his age, being 20/21 at that time to be "too old" for the rest of the group. </p>

	<p>After both original members left, the company put Chris in the group and recruited a female rapper named Sori, 4 months before the group was going to make their comeback. This is one of their most popular albums and led them to fame, chaning from a hiphop style to a more pop,funk and 80's theme. Their lead single, topped the charts in music shows and even where MC's for a music show called Music Tank! They also had 3 follow up songs before ending promotions, during the end, member Sori left the at the end and was expected to become a soloist but it was then denied as Sori had different aspirations and for difference of passion when she first performed to her last, which shows the amount she trained may have been a reason for her sudden departure.</p>

	<p>No new member were added in the group after but the group sparked controversy and are known as the biggest bullying scandal. It was said that Jiyoung was the reason the group began because she was born wealthy and wanted to be singer so her family payed to make the group with her friends but Jihye joined because of the producer who at the time was also known as recruiting people in the company. This sparked to jelousy as JiYoung was supposed to be the lead vocalist but was then changed for the second album due to her vocal range being too low for some songs that have been made. This then went on to bribing Chris into joining in and isolating her while Seokhyun was a bystander. It went on for a long time to the point that in thier performance Jihye was even isolated to not gain much attention but due to fans not knowing the scandal, they loved it and made Jiyoung even more jelous. It all came down in 2002 where they broke out and later their manager was supposed to hide the bullying but he spoke about what really happened and ended the group. It wasnt till 2009 where they met again in a show that they then apologized and made things up.</p>

	<p>I want to go anywhere with you. I guess this is what it feels like to be in love</p> 

	<h4>Verse 2</h4>
	
	<p>Let's go, just the two of us.</p> 

	<p>The white snow-covered sea I want to see it with you I'll lean on your shoulder like a love scene in a movie</p>

	<h4>Pre-Chorus</h4>

	<p> It won't matter if anyone sees us (If anyone sees) Because this is the first of many nights that we'll be together</p> 

	<h4>Chorus</h4>

	<p>I'll shake off all other thoughts cause I'm happy enough with just you and I wish this moment could last forever</p> 

	<p>Will you only love me like you do now? I can't ask for more as I can't wait to be your girlfriend and open our eyes together every day<p> 

	<h4>Narration</h4>
