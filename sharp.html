	<h3>S#arp's 2nd Album, 7th Track - Shall We Go?</h3>

	<h3>Context</h3>

	<p>S#ARP is a kpop Co-ed group that had three different lineups. In their debut in 1998, it consisted of John Kim, Seo Ji Young, Oh Hee Jung, Lee Ji Hye, and Jang Seok hyun and they debuted with a Hip Hop, Rap conept with a mix of pop and funk. During Promotions, their company added Christopher Kim, a rapper who used to be in a duo in early 98', who is known as a guest with the group. Also during promotions, HeeJung left due to health complications and family conflicts as she was in the group. By the end, John Kim left the group due to differences for the plans in the next album and also due to his age, being 20/21 at that time to be "too old" for the rest of the group. </p>

	<br>

	<p>After both original members left, the company put Chris in the group and recruited a female rapper named Sori, 4 months before the group was going to make their comeback. </p>
